TODO
- Notes about the protocol type on github
- Count how many planes have been shot down and the reasons (e.g. slow communications)
	- Statistics
x- Comment code!
- Higher order knowledge
x- One step and simulation possibility (e.g. 2 buttons)
x- Description of components on github (turret, planes, etc)
x- Fix connections when removing planes

- Delete turret messages when a new plane is spawned (i.e. the previous has been destroyed /crashed)
- An enemy plane does not respond with 'unknown' when it receives a message, but sends no message at all.  
- Move knowledge of plane lifetime to turrets. 

- Main research question:
	- Which protocol works best in avoiding shooting down friendly planes?
		- i.e. has the lowest kill count
