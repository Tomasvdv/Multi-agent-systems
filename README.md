## Friend or Foe Identification system
### Introduction
This research focuses on analyzing a Friend or Foe Identification System (IFF). Since the invention of radar for localizing enemy planes in WWII, the problem of identifying planes as friend or foe has been around. Because in WW1 the planes were relatively slow and performed more close combat, the planes could be marked with colours to help distinguishing between friends and foes. However, as planes became faster and were flying at higher altitudes, this identification method became obsolete. In WWII the first IFF systems were invented to prevent friendly fire incidents and to aid the overall decision making process in tactical plans. IFF was therefore first used by the military, but the system was later on also used for civilian air traffic.
<br />
Radar-based IFF systems generally consist of a sender that sends a (possibly encrypted) message to a plane. The plane's transponder responds by sending a message back to the sender, which is verified by the sender. The sender can be based on many platforms, e.g. ground defense bases, ships, other planes, etc. IFF systems are only able to positively identify friends. It is not the case (as the name may suggest) that IFF systems are able to positively identify enemy aircraft. 
The latter is due to the fact that the sender can only derive that a plane is friendly if it gets a response back from the plane, but if it doesn't get a response, the plane does not neccessarily have to be a foe.
